*** EXAMPLE PROGRAM ***

C++ program for finite-difference simulation of one-dimensional electrochemical systems (planar, spherical 
and cylindrical electrodes) with asymmetric (N,2) high-order approximation for the space derivatives (from 3- to 7-point 
approximations), exponentially expanding grids and making use of a sparse matrix algorithm (EIGEN_SP). 

The program can be compiled in any Linux-like system with 'EIGEN' (a C++ template library for linear algebra: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org).
The Makefile file mus be adapted to the environment. Once edited, type 'make' at the command line within the file directory.

The resulting executable "Example.exe" creates the file "Example_001" with the simulation results in three
columns: dimensionless time \t dimensionless potential \t dimensionless current.


The files can be readily edited and extended to other values of parameters and/or geometries, mechanisms and techniques.

The following source and header files can be found:

*'main.cpp'
It includes the values of the system's variables (electrode geometry, thermodynamic and kinetic magnitudes, etc.) 
and of the parameters for the simulations (spatial grid, timesteps, derivative approximations, etc.).

* 'CoefsAlphaBeta.cpp', 'CoefsAlphaBeta.h'
Functions for the calculation of the coefficients of the (N,2) forms (with N=3-7) for the approximation of 
the first and second space derivatives. 
It also contains the formulae of other (N,M) forms, including the (N,1) approximations (with N=3-6) for the 
calculation of the species surface flux.

* 'simul.cpp', 'simul.h'
Functions for the filling of the matrix and for the resolution of the system of linear equations with the sparse
matrix routine 'EIGEN_SP'.

* 'somedefs.h'
Definitions of the system's variables and numerical simulation's parameters.

* 'somefuncs.cpp', 'somefuncs.h'
It includes:
Calculation of the first-interval amplitude
Calculation of the CV potential perturbation
Default values of the system's variables and the simulation's parameters
